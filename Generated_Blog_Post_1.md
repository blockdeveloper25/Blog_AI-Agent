**Post 2: Agentic Design Patterns**

"Did you know there are four key agentic design patterns? 🤔

1️⃣ Reflection: where AI asks itself questions to improve its output
2️⃣ Tool Use: where AI uses tools to break down tasks and execute specific parts
3️⃣ Planning and Reasoning: where AI figures out the exact steps to accomplish a task
4️⃣ Multi-Agent Systems: where multiple AIs work together to achieve a common goal

Learn more about these design patterns and how you can apply them in your business or personal life! 💻 #AgenticDesignPatterns #AI #MachineLearning"

**Post 3: Tool Use Example**

"Want to see an example of Tool Use in action? 🤔 Here's a scenario where AI uses web search tools to answer a question:

This is just one example of how agentic design patterns can improve your results! 💡 #ToolUse #AgenticDesignPatterns"

**Post 4: Multi-Agent Systems Example**

"Imagine having multiple AIs working together like a team to achieve a common goal. 🤝 That's what Multi-Agent Systems are all about!

For example, you could have one AI searching for information, another AI analyzing data, and a third AI summarizing the results.
